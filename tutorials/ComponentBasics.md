when creating a component - alwasys use PascalCase for components, ( first letter capitalized) like "Header.jsx", not "header.jsx"
Component name shuold be matched to its jsx name
use descriptive, specific names that indicate the component's purpose, ( e.g,. ProductCard.jsx not just Card.jsx)


----- 

In React every component is a function. which returns JSX ( a HTML like syntax in javascript)
